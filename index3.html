        <p><h1>Linear Equations</h1></p>
        <br>
        <h3>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</h3>
        <sup><h1>ax + b = 0</h1></sup>
        <br>
        <h3>where a and b are real numbers and x is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an x so don’t get too locked into always seeing an x there.</h3>
        <br>
        <p><h1>Quadratic Equation</h1></p>
        <br>
        <h3>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</h3>
        <sub><h1>ax^2 + bx + c = 0</h1></sub>
        <h3>where a, b, c are known values and x is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, a can't be 0.</h3>
        <br>
        <p><h1>The area of a circle (A)</h1></p>
        <br>
        <h3>(Pi) times the radius<span>(r)</span>squared:</h3>
        <sup><h1>A=Pixr2</h1></sup>
        <h3>or, when you know the diameter (D):</h3>
        <sup><h1>A=(Pi/4)x D</h1></sup>
        <h3>or, when you know the circumference (C):</h3>
        <sup><h1>A = C^2 / 4 x Pi</h1></sup>
        <br>
        <p><h1>Intersection</h1></p>
        <br>
        <h3>The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A n B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,</h3>
        <sup><h1>A n B={x:xЭA and xЭB}</h1></sup>
        <h3>That is, x is an element of the intersection A n B if and only if x is both an element of A and an element of B.</h3>
